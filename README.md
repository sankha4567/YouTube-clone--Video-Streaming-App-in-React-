# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Debouncing:typing slow=.differnece beween key stroke very high time
typing fast=differebce between key stroke is very less
performance:
iphone pro max =14*1000=14000
with debouncing 3*1000=3000 api calls
debouncing with 200 ms:if diff between two key stroke leass than < 200,i should not call the api
> 200 make api call and show result
